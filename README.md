Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

##### Files:

`<CodeBook.md>` is a code book that describes the variables, data, and  transformations that wsere performed to tidy the data.

`<run_analysis.R>` performs the data preparation and the following 5 steps as outlined in the course projectâ€™s definition:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each    activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the final dataset exported, after going through the steps listed above.
